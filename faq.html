            <h4>e-Voting is voting through an electronic system where members/shareholders can vote on resolutions of
                companies requiring members/shareholders consent. The need for e-Voting arises when a company wishes to
                pass a resolution by Postal Ballot/AGM/EGM which requires members/shareholders consent. Ministry of
                Corporate Affairs has authorised NSDL for setting up an electronic platform to facilitate
                members/shareholders to cast vote in electronic form. Accordingly, NSDL has set-up an electronic
                infrastructure to facilitate members/shareholders to cast votes in electronic form through internet.
